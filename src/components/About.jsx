                            I began my professional career in the field of finance but shortly after found myself
                            drained by the lack of creativity and innovation in the field. After taking a short hiatus
                            from finance and exploring alternative fields, I realized I am a self starter by nature and
                            thrive in energetic, fast paced environments. I was introduced to coding by my network of
                            friends and found myself excited every time I opened my laptop to learn about coding. The
                            were no limits with what I can create. I took the chance on formally developing my development
                            skills and completed a full stack development apprenticeship in a health start up, both of which
                            polished my skills and provided me with real world side projects. Iâ€™ve never been more prepared 
                            to bring my skill set to a full time role where I can continue learn to and contribute to.
